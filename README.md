# car_infotainment_ui
A simple UI for car infotainment that is both touch and button/clickwheel-friendly.

This is my vision of a proper car infotainment system. Whether the vehicle is operating by a clickwheel or various
automakers' touch screens.

Assumptions are:
* UI only controls entertainment/navigation/OBDII-specific settings
* Does NOT operate climate control as I believe knobs are still the most functional implementation from a usability standpoint
* Use of red is easier on eyes during dark and light situations (ergonomic)
* Buttons large enough for driver visibility and touch usability
